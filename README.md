**Live Demo:** [https://syogesh999.github.io/Mind-Music/](https://syogesh999.github.io/Mind-Music/)

## 📖 Project Overview

**Mind Music AR** is an interactive, browser-based music creation platform that leverages **hand tracking** and **augmented reality (AR) visuals**. Control an arpeggiator, drum machine, and real-time waveform visualizer — all through intuitive hand gestures.  
Simply grant webcam access, raise your hands, and start making music with natural movements.

### Key Features

- 🎹 **Hand-Controlled Arpeggiator:** Change notes and instruments using gestures.
- 🥁 **Gesture-Based Drum Machine:** Trigger drum sounds with specific finger movements.
- 🎨 **3D Real-Time Waveform Visualizer:** Powered by Three.js for immersive visuals.
- 🎚️ **Advanced Music Controls:** Volume, play/pause, shuffle, repeat, and progress seek.
- 🎛️ **Customizable Settings:** Adjust arpeggiator speed and drum volume.
- ⚡ **No Installation Required:** Runs directly in your browser.
