# Mind Music AR 🎵🖐️

**Live Demo:** [https://syogesh999.github.io/Mind-Music/](https://syogesh999.github.io/Mind-Music/)

## 📖 Project Description
**Mind Music AR** is an **interactive, browser-based music creation experience** that uses **hand tracking** and **augmented reality visuals** to let you control an arpeggiator, drum machine, and real-time waveform visualizer — all with your hands.  
Simply grant access to your webcam, raise your hands, and start making music through gestures.

### Features
- 🎹 **Hand-controlled arpeggiator** (change notes & instruments with gestures)
- 🥁 **Gesture-based drum machine** (trigger drums with specific fingers)
- 🎨 **Real-time waveform visualizer** in 3D (powered by Three.js)
- 🎚️ Enhanced music controls (volume, play/pause, shuffle, repeat, progress seek)
- 🎛️ Adjustable arp speed & drum volume
- ⚡ Works directly in the browser, no install needed

## ⚙️ Setup for Development

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syogesh999/Mind-Music.git
cd Mind-Music
```

### 2️⃣ Start a Local Server

Since the project uses ES modules and webcam APIs, you need to run it from a local server:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node.js live-server
npx live-server
```

Then open: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### 3️⃣ Enable Webcam

Allow your browser to access your webcam when prompted.

## 📦 Requirements

- **Browser:** Chrome/Edge (latest), with Webcam & WebGL support
- **Node.js** (optional, for development tools)
- **Local HTTP server** to avoid CORS issues with modules
- Internet connection (loads some assets and libraries from CDNs)

If you want, I can also add **gesture control instructions** so users know exactly how to interact with your AR music environment. That would make the README even more user-friendly. Would you like me to add that?
