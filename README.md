# Mind Music AR 🎵🖐️

**Live Demo:** [https://syogesh999.github.io/Mind-Music/](https://syogesh999.github.io/Mind-Music/)

## 📖 Project Description

**Mind Music AR** is an **interactive, browser-based music creation experience** that uses **hand tracking** and **augmented reality visuals** to let you control an arpeggiator, drum machine, and real-time waveform visualizer — all with your hands.  
Simply grant access to your webcam, raise your hands, and start making music through gestures.

### Features

- 🎹 **Hand-controlled arpeggiator** (change notes & instruments with gestures)
- 🥁 **Gesture-based drum machine** (trigger drums with specific fingers)
- 🎨 **Real-time waveform visualizer** in 3D (powered by Three.js)
- 🎚️ Enhanced music controls (volume, play/pause, shuffle, repeat, progress seek)
- 🎛️ Adjustable arp speed & drum volume
- ⚡ Works directly in the browser, no install needed

## 🖥️ Live Demo

[**Click here to try it now**](https://syogesh999.github.io/Mind-Music/) — Works best in **Google Chrome** on desktop.

## ⚙️ Setup for Development

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syogesh999/Mind-Music.git
cd Mind-Music
```
````

### 2️⃣ Start a Local Server

Since the project uses ES modules and webcam APIs, you need to run it from a local server:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node.js live-server
npx live-server
```

Then open: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### 3️⃣ Enable Webcam

Allow your browser to access your webcam when prompted.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- **Browser:** Chrome/Edge (latest), with Webcam & WebGL support
- **Node.js** (optional, for development tools)
- **Local HTTP server** to avoid CORS issues with modules
- Internet connection (loads some assets and libraries from CDNs)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** – 3D graphics & visualization
- **[Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)** – Web Audio API music synthesis
- **[MediaPipe Hands](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker)** – Real-time hand tracking
- **Vanilla JavaScript ES Modules** – Core logic
- **HTML5 / CSS3** – Structure & styling

If you want, I can also add **gesture control instructions** so users know exactly how to interact with your AR music environment. That would make the README even more user-friendly. Would you like me to add that?
